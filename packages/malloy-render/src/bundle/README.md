## This sub-package.

This sub-package provides a simple mechanism to create a bundled js file which can be used as Malloy Renderer in non node environments such as IPython notebooks.
Run `npm run bundle_renderer` from `malloy/packages/malloy-render`. This will create `bundled_renderer.js` and `bundled_renderer.js.map`.
