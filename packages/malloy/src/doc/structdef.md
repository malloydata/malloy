# `StructDef`

The most basic `StructDef` is a namespace. `StructDef`s become a `FieldSpace`" in the translator pass and `QueryStruct` in the compiler.

```TypeScript
interface StructDefBase extends HasLocation, NamedObject {
  type: string;
  annotation?: Annotation;
  modelAnnotation?: ModelAnnotation;
  fields: FieldDef[];
  dialect: string;
}
```

> [`FieldDef`](fielddef.md) has an explainer page too.

Some StructDefs are also "sources" in the Malloy meaning of that word, and to be a source, they need some additional properties.

```TypeScript
interface SourceDefBase
  extends StructDefBase, Filtered, ResultStructMetadata
{
  arguments?: Record<string, Argument>;
  parameters?: Record<string, Parameter>;
  queryTimezone?: string;
  connection: string;
  primaryKey?: PrimaryKeyRef;
}
```

A record, for example, is a structdef which is not a source, and doesn't have the properties required in a source, but it is a namespace, so it is a StructDef but not a SourceDef, this isn't REALLY what a record struct def looks like, (more on the later) but at this point in the document, pretend it is

```TypeScript
interface RecordDef extends StructDefBase {
    type: 'record';
}
```

> Confession: The `type:` namespace for structs and fields is merged. Not every struct is a field, not every field is a struct, but there are entities which are both structs and fields. Old Malloy said "All structs are legal in field lists" but some of them will never happen we promise,
new Malloy is explicit about which are legal. I didn't want to add two discriminators "structType" and "fieldType" for the many items which are both structs and can be in field lists, so, like Old Malloy, new Malloy shares the 'type:' namespace betweens structs and fields.

## Simple Table

This simple table with two columns ...

```SQL
CREATE TABLE 'malloydata.simple_table'
   stringField STRING,
   intField INTEGER;
```

... as a `StructDef` ...

```TypeScript
interface TableSourceDef extends SourceDefBase {
    type: 'table';
    tablePath: string;
}

const simpleTable: TableSourceDef = {
    type: 'table';
    tablePath: 'malloydata.simple_table';
    connection: 'bigquery';
    dialect: 'standardsql';
    fields: [
        {name: 'stringField', type: 'string'},
        {name: 'intField', type: 'number', numberType: 'integer' },
    ]
}
```

### Simple Table, with a record

Let's start by making a record which looks a like a row of `malloydata.simple_table`

```TypeScript
const simpleRecord: RecordDef {
    type: 'record',
    dialect: 'standardsql',
    fields: simpleTable.fields
};
```

> Note that a record needs to have a dialect, because there often expressions in
> field lists and the dialect is needed in the compiler still, in a variety of
> places, when constructing name spaces. It was simpler to make every struct def
> have a dialect than to make every struct def have a way to find it's parent

Now lets make a table which has that record ...

```TypeScript
const table2: TableSourceDef = {
    ...simpleTable,
    fields: [
        {
            ...simpleRecord
            name: 'recordField',
            join: 'one',
            matrixOperation: 'left'
        },
    ],
}
```

> Everything which is treated like a join by the IR has a `join:` field. All records are joined, so every record in a field list will have a `join:` keyword. So a non-repeated record is actually
```TypeScript
interface NonRepeatedRecordStruct extends StructDefBase, JoinBase {
    type: 'record';
    join: 'one';
    matrixOperation: 'left'; // this is optional and defaults to left
}
```

## Arrays

A simple array of integers has a data type like this

```TypeScript
// An array is not always a struct, it can just be a data type, so it does NOT extend StructDefbase
interface ArrayTypeDef extends NamedObject {
    type: 'array';
    dataType: AtomicFieldType;
}

// If an array is joined, so it un-nests, is a StructDef, it will look like this
interface ScalarArrayStruct extends ArrayTypeDef, StructDefBase, JoinBase {
    type: 'array'
    dataType: AtomicFieldType;
    join: 'many'
    fields: [] // will be filled with the magic value to un-nest on ".each"
};
```

## Table with two arrays, one joined

```TypeScript
const intType: NumberTypeDef = {type: 'number', numberType: 'integer'};
const arrayOfInts: ArrayTypeDef = {type: 'array', dataType: intType};
const table3: TableSourceDef {
    name: 'table3',
    dialect: 'standardsql'
    tablePath: 'malloytest.table3',
    connection: 'bigquery',
    fields: [
        {name: 'un_joined_ints', ...arrayOfInts}, // Just a name and a type, not a struct, no fields
        {
            name: 'joined_ints',                  // This will be a ScalarArrayStruct
            ...arrayOfInts,
            join: 'many',
            dialect: 'standardsql',
            fields: [{name: 'each', type: intType, e: {node: 'array_unnest', arrayName: 'joined_ints' }}],
        }
    ]
}
```

## Table with repeated records

Repeated records are represented as an array of records. The fields array of a repeated record is
the schema for each row, just as it is for a non-repeated record. We use `'record_element'` as the `dataType:` for this because the schema for the record is still in THIS `StructDef`, not inside a `{type: record ...`
definition in the `dataType:` field. Which is a little weird, but a side effect of how nested data is
treated like a join in the compiler.

```TypeScript
interface RepeatedRecordStruct extends ScalarArrayStruct {
    type: 'array'
    dataType: {type: 'record_element'}
}
```

Which, when joined into a table would look like this ...

```TypeScript
const table4: TableSourceDef {
    name: 'table4',
    dialect: 'standardsql'
    tablePath: 'malloytest.table4',
    connection: 'bigquery',
    fields: [
        {name: 'eachRowHasAString', type: 'string' }, // StringTypeDef & FieldDefBase
        {                                             // RepeatedRecordStruct & FieldDefBase
            name: 'eachRowHasARepeatedSimpleReord',
            type: 'array',
            dataType: 'record_element',
            join: 'many',
            matrixOperation: 'left',
            dialect: 'standardsql',
            fields: simpleRecord.fields,
        },
    ],
};
```

## All the struct defs

```TypeScript
type SourceDef =
    | TableSourceDef
    | SelectSourceDef       // CONNECTION_NAME.sql("SELECT ....")
    | QuerySourceDef        // A query as a source, contains the query
    | QueryResultDef        // The computed output schema of a query without the query
    | NestSourceDef         // Special input to a nested query
    | FinalizeSourceDef;    // Use to re-write final stage of PostGres queries

type StructDef =
    | SourceDef
    | NonRepeatedRecordStruct
    | ScalarArrayStruct
    | RepeatedRecordStruct;
```

## Discrimintators

* `isSourceDef` -- Is the structdef a sourcedef
* `isBaseTable` -- Is this the "FROM" clause structdef.
* `isJoined` -- Is this NOT the FROM clause structdef
* `isJoinable` -- Is the something which could be joined
* `isJoinedSource` --- Is this joined AND a SourceDef
* `isScalarArray` -- Is this an array, and is this an array of non-records
