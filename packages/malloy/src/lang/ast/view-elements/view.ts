/**
 * A `View` represents a sequence of operations to be performed on a
 * source to generate a query. A `View` can generate a pipeline from
 * a given `FieldSpace`, or it can refine an exisitng pipeline.
 *
 * In Malloy code, a `View` represents any view or nest definition/reference,
 * or the part of a query after the first `->` or `+`.
 *
 * e.g. the part after the `is` in:
 *   `view: x is { group_by: carrier }`
 *   `view: x is by_carrier + { where: state = 'CA' }`
 * e.g. after the colon in `nest: by_carrier`
 * e.g. after the plus in `run: flights_by_carrier + { limit: 10 }`
 * e.g. after the arrow in `run: flights -> by_carrier`
