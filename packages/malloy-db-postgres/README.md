# Malloy

Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. It is both a semantic modeling language and a querying language that runs queries against a relational database. Malloy currently connects to BigQuery and Postgres, and natively supports DuckDB. We've built a Visual Studio Code extension to facilitate building Malloy data models, querying and transforming data, and creating simple visualizations and dashboards.

## This package

This package facilitates using the `malloydata/malloy` library with Postgres - see [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy/blob/main/packages/malloy/README.md) for additional information.
