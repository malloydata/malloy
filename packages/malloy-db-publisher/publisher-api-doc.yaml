  title: Malloy Publisher - Semantic Model Serving API
  description: |
    The Malloy Publisher - Semantic Model Serving API provides comprehensive access to Malloy packages and their associated resources.
    A Malloy package is a directory containing Malloy models (.malloy files), Malloy notebooks (.malloynb files), and embedded databases
    (.parquet files) with a malloy-publisher.json manifest at the package's root directory.

    ## Key Features

    - **Project Management**: Create and manage projects with their associated packages and connections
    - **Package Lifecycle**: Full CRUD operations for Malloy packages and their versions
    - **Model & Notebook Access**: Retrieve and execute Malloy models and notebooks
    - **Connection Management**: Secure database connection configuration and testing
    - **Query Execution**: Execute queries against models and retrieve results
    - **Watch Mode**: Real-time file watching for development workflows

    ## Resource Hierarchy

    The API follows a hierarchical resource structure:
    ```
    Projects
    ├── Connections
    └── Packages
        ├── Models
        ├── Notebooks
        └── Databases
    ```

    For examples, see the Malloy samples packages (https://github.com/malloydata/malloy-samples) repository.
