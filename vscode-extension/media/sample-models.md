## FAA

This set of models points at a publicly available FAA flights dataset including information on flights, airports, aircrafts and aircraft models from 2000 to 2005. A wide variety of patterns and features are used in this model and any of our examples in documentation are based on this dataset, so it's a great place to start as you get to know Malloy.

## Iowa Liquor

Liquor sales in Iowa are state-controlled, with all liquor wholesale run by the state. All purchases and sales of liquor that stores make are a matter of public record. A walkthrough of exploring and modeling this dataset can be found [here](https://looker-open-source.github.io/malloy/documentation/examples/iowa/iowa.md); this makes a great introduction to Malloy.

## Ecommerce

This model points to a dataset for a fictitious ecommerce business. It has a  clean and typical schema for a transactional dataset. It also includes an example of an interesting brand affinity analysis (people who buy x also buy y).

## GA Sessions

Malloy is ideally suited to working with nested data, and this is the place to see why. See how easily data at any level of nesting can be accessed and aggregated without needlessly complex queries or use of CTEs.

## Hacker News

This is just a fun dataset. Includes examples of using regular expressions to parse data, [pick](https://looker-open-source.github.io/malloy/documentation/language/expressions#pick-expressions) (Malloy's improvement upon CASE statements), and [imports](https://looker-open-source.github.io/malloy/documentation/language/imports.md) to spin off a specific analysis of posts about FAANG companies.

## Names

A look at baby names in the United States by gender, state, and year, since 1910. Includes an example of cohorting names by aggregating safely across different levels of nesting.

## Wordlebot

Let Wordlebot solve Wordle for you (or if you're like us, see if it can beat you after you've played!). This is an example of an advanced analysis to solve a tricky problem. We have a walkthrough and examples of how we used the model to solve Wordle puzzles available [here](https://looker-open-source.github.io/malloy/documentation/examples/wordle/wordle.md).
