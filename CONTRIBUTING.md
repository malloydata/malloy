## Copyright and Licensing

Submissions to the Malloy project have come from a number of sources, and a glance through the repository will reveal a few different copyright headers and licenses. This is an artifact of the history of the Malloy project and the result of accepting contributions from as many people as we can.

Contributions to the Malloy project must be licensed under an [MIT-Style](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.

### Adding New Files

Contributors who are adding new files to the repository have a couple of options. Our preferred option is for files to have this copyright header (with appropriate comment characters to match the
language of the new file):

```
/*
 * Copyright Contributors to the Malloy project
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
 */
```

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, you may wish to discuss with your legal department about whether they require you to include a copyright notice identifying the employer as the copyright holder in contributions. Many of our membersâ€™ legal departments have already approved the above recommended practice. However we remain open to discussing other options as long as the resulting license is compatible with our MIT license.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All new inbound code contributions must also be accompanied by a Developer
Certificate of Origin (http://developercertificate.org) sign-off in the source
code system that is submitted through a TSC-approved contribution process which
will bind the authorized contributor and, if not self-employed, their employer
to the applicable license.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a
Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

Git has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit
message, for example:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

All pull requests must pass tests. Outside contributors should contact the Malloy
team via the`#developing` channel on the [Malloy Slack](https://malloydata.github.io/slack).
