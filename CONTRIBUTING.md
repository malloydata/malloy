## Developer Certificate of Origin

All new inbound code contributions must also be accompanied by a Developer 
Certificate of Origin (http://developercertificate.org) sign-off in the source 
code system that is submitted through a TSC-approved contribution process which 
will bind the authorized contributor and, if not self-employed, their employer 
to the applicable license.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a 
Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

Git has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit
message, for example:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
``` 

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
