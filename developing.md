## Building Malloy

Building the Malloy repo requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and a [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (JRE 1.6 or higher, 1.8 recommended) installed on your system in order to build the Malloy project.

Alternatively, you can use [nix](https://nixos.org/) to install these dependencies. To use nix,Â install it with `curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh` and then run `nix-shell` from the `malloy/` directory. Nix is what _CI_ uses to run builds.

The following will install dependencies for the entire set of packages and compile both the Malloy language and the VSCode extension.

```bash
npm install
npm run package-extension
```

Use the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for code formatting, or run `npm run lint --fix`.

The tests can be run via the [VS Code Jest Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner). Alternatively, use `npm run test`, or a specific file, like `npm run test test/nomodel.spec.ts`.

Some of the Postgres tests depend on static tables (i.e. `test/src/nomodel.spec.ts`). To set up the database locally for these tests, you can `gunzip` the `test/sql/malloytest-postgres.sql.gz` file and run its SQL with a command such as `psql -f test/sql/malloytest-postgres.sql`.

### VS Code tips

We provide a task in VS Code (.vscode/tasks.json) to watch the entire Malloy repo for typscript changes - this allows VS Code to output typescript errors even when files are closed. The default behavior is for errors to only appear in open files. If you want the watcher task to compile all files in the background, you can either run the task manually (Command Palette -> Tasks -> Run Task -> tsc-compile-watch). If you want to enable this task to always start when you open the project, run Command Palette -> Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder -> Allow Automatic Tasks in folder.

## Running Tests

See `test/README.md` for infomration about running tests.

## Malloy VSCode Extension

The Malloy VSCode extension's source is in the `vscode-extension` directory.

### Installation

To build and install the current version of the extension, first ensure that you've followed the steps to install the dependencies for the Malloy Repo. **Note: You will need to re-run the below any time you pull in new changes.** Then run:

```bash
npm run package-extension
```

Next, in VSCode _EITHER_:

1. Run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX" command (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P opens the command interface), then select `vscode-extension/dist/malloy-vscode-x.x.x.vsix`

_OR_

2. Open the `vscode-extension` folder root directory in VSCode, right click on `dist/malloy-vscode-x.x.x.vsix` and select "Install Extension VSIX".

# Malloy and Extension Development

## Running and Debugging

1. Open the top-level repository directory in VSCode
2. Select the "Run and Debug" panel in the left bar.
3. Click the green arrow "Run" button, with the "Run Extension" profile selected.

Optional: To additionally debug the language server, run the "Attach to Language Server"
launch profile from the "Run and Debug" panel.

## Telemetry

For telemetry to work in development, you need to have the `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` and `GA_API_SECRET` environment variables set to appropriate values. In order for these to be populated when using the "Run Malloy Extension" VSCode launch configuration, they need to be in a `.env` file at the top level of the repo, like so:

```
GA_MEASUREMENT_ID='<id goes here>'
GA_API_SECRET='<secret goes here>'
```
