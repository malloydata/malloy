// Sessionization -
//  This is a subset of the data.
//
//  If we think of aircraft flights as a transaction.  We can roll up all transactions
//  in a given day by a carrier into a single nested table.
//
//  In the result you can see that Delta had 13 flights on 03-03 and the individual
//    aircraft events (ordered through the day)
//
//  see: https://malloydata.github.io/malloy/documentation/patterns/foreign_sums.html
