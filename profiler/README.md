# Malloy Stable Request Profiler

This package enables profiling of the Malloy compiler. Currently it only works with stateless compilation of queries. In the future we can extend it support other kinds of compilation.

Usage:

- Write a Malloy query request to a file.
- Run `npm run profile path/to/file.json`
