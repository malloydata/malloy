# NTSB Flight Database Examples

_The follow examples all run against the model at the bottom of this page OR you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/malloy/blob/docs-release/samples/faa/flights.malloy)._

## Airport Dashboard
Where can you fly from SJC? For each destination; Which carriers?  How long have they been flying there?
Are they on time?

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true, "source": "faa/flights.malloy", "runMode": "auto",  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size": "large"}
query: flights -> airport_dashboard { where: origin.code ? 'SJC' }
```


## Carrier Dashboard
Tell me everything about a carrier.  How many destinations?, flights? hubs?
What kind of planes to they use? How many flights over time?  What are
the major hubs?  For each destination, How many flights? Where can you? Have they been
flying there long?  Increasing or decreasing year by year?  Any seasonality?

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true, "source": "faa/flights.malloy", "runMode": "auto",  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size": "large"}
query: flights -> carrier_dashboard { where: carriers.nickname  ? 'Jetblue' }
```


## Kayak Example Query
Suppose you wanted to build a website like Kayak.  Let's assume that the data we have is
in the future instead of the past.  The query below will fetch all the data needed
to render a Kayak page in a singe query.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true, "source": "faa/flights.malloy", "runMode": "auto", "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size": "large"}
query: flights -> kayak {
  where:
    origin.code = 'SJC',
    destination.code = 'LAX'|'BUR',
    dep_time = @2004-01-01
}
```

## Sessionizing Flight Data.
You can think of flight data as event data.  The below is a classic map/reduce roll up of the flight data by carrier and day, plane and day, and individual events for each plane.

```malloy
query: sessionize is {
  group_by: flight_date is dep_time.day
  group_by: carrier
  aggregate: daily_flight_count is flight_count
  nest: per_plane_data is {
    top: 20
    group_by: tail_num
    aggregate: plane_flight_count is flight_count
    nest: flight_legs is {
      order_by: 2
      group_by:
        tail_num
        dep_minute is dep_time.minute
        origin_code
        dest_code is destination_code
        dep_delay
        arr_delay
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true, "source": "faa/flights.malloy", "runMode": "auto", "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size": "large"}
query: flights { where: carrier ?'WN', dep_time ? @2002-03-03 } -> sessionize
```

## The Malloy Model

All of the queries above are executed against the following model:

```malloy

## Data Styles
The data styles tell the Malloy renderer how to render different kinds of results.

```json
{
  "by_carrier": {
    "renderer": "bar_chart"
  },
  "year_over_year": {
    "renderer": "line_chart"
  },
  "by_month": {
    "renderer": "line_chart"
  },
  "by_manufacturer": {
    "renderer": "bar_chart"
  },
  "routes_map": {
    "renderer": "segment_map"
  },
  "destinations_by_month": {
    "renderer": "line_chart"
  },
  "delay_by_hour_of_day": {
    "renderer" : "scatter_chart"
  },
  "seats_by_distance": {
    "renderer": "scatter_chart"
  },
  "carriers_by_month" : {
    "renderer": "line_chart"
