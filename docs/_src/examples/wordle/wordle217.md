# Puzzle #217

Wordlebot is written in [Malloy](https://github.com/malloydata/malloy/). Read about [How Wordlebot is constructed](wordle.md) (only 50 lines of code) and a good example of using data to solve interesting problems.


## Query for the best starting words.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "/inline/w2.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle -> find_words
```

Skipping 'SAREE' to avoid duplicates this early in the game, let's go with 'SLATE' again.

## The Second Guess
One green match--not a bad start. Let's find more words ending in E.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "/inline/w2.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle -> find_words {
  where:
    word ~ r'....E',      // GREEN: E at the end
    not word ~ r'[SLAT]'  // GRAY doesn't have these characters
}
```

The 'PRICE' is right, or something...

## Round 3: Tie Breaking
That worked nicely for us, we have two green matches and now we need to figure out where 'I' belong(s).

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "/inline/w2.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle -> find_words {
  where:
    word ~ r'I',
    word ~ r'..[^I]CE',
    word !~ r'[SLATPR]'
}
```

Another tie, today with a chance to guess just how into cooking the Wordle creators are. We can use our same letter commonality tie-breaker here; maybe this time we'll look at letter commonality for first position.

```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "/inline/w2.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
  query: wordle -> {
    where: letters.position = 1
    group_by: letters.letter
    aggregate:
      word_count
      use_count is letters.count()
  }
  ```

'M' appears to be a little more common as a first letter than 'W' so we went with that.

## Solved in 3.5 again



```malloy
--! {"isRunnable": true,  "isPaginationEnabled": false, "pageSize": 100, "size":"small","source": "/inline/w2.malloy", "showAs":"html"}
query: wordle -> find_words {
  where:
    word ~ r'.INCE',
    word !~ r'[SLATPRM]'
}
```

There it is, and our solution also happens to describe our reaction after missing that coin-toss! We'll go ahead and call this one 3.5 again based on the last round.

### Code For Wordlebot:

```malloy
// Make a table of 5 letter words
source: words is table('malloy-data.malloytest.words') {
  query: five_letter_words is {
    where: length(word) = 5 and word ~ r'^[a-z]{5}$'
    project: word is upper(word)
  }
}

// Cross join numbers
source: numbers is table('malloy-data.malloytest.numbers') {
  where: num <= 5
}

// Build a new table of word and each letter in position
query: words_and_position is from(words->five_letter_words) {
  // Cross join is missing at the moment
  join_cross: numbers
} -> {
  group_by: word
  nest: letters is {
    order_by: 2
    group_by:
      letter is substr(word, numbers.num, 1)
      position is numbers.num
  }
}

// Build a word finder that can generate a score best available guess
source: wordle is from(-> words_and_position) {
  where: word !~ r'(S|ED)$'
  measure: word_count is count()

  query: find_words is {
    group_by:
      letters.letter
      letters.position
    aggregate: word_count
    nest: words_list is {
      group_by: word
    }
  } -> {
    group_by: words_list.word
    aggregate: score is word_count.sum()
  }
}
```
