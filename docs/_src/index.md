# About Malloy

Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. It is an analytical language that runs on SQL databases. It provides the ability to define a semantic data model and query it. Malloy currently works with SQL databases BigQuery, Postgres, and DuckDB.
- Queries compile to SQL, optimized for your database.
- Has both a semantic data model and a query language.  The semantic model contains reusable calculations and definitions, making queries short and readable.
- Excels at reading and writing nested data sets.
- Things that are complicated in SQL are simple to express in Malloy. For example: level of detail calculations, percent of total, aggregating against multiple tables across a join safely, date operations, reasonable ordering by default, and more.

Malloy is a work in progress. Malloy is designed to be a language for anyone who works with SQL--whether youâ€™re an analyst, data scientist, data engineer, or someone building a data application. If you know SQL, Malloy will feel familiar, while more powerful and efficient. Malloy allows you to model as you go, so there is no heavy up-front work before you can start answering complex questions, and you're never held back or restricted by the model.

## Try Malloy Today:
