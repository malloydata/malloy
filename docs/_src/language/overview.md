# The Malloy Language

Malloy is a language design to provide a concise, powerful, and
readable vocabulary to express the kinds of data transformations
needed to extract useful information from a relational database.
Malloy is essentially a Domain-specific Language (DSL) where the
"domain" is "exploration and transformation of SQL datasets."

This section is designed to be an explorable reference to the
underlying language. For an overview of malloy, refer to the [Basics of 
Malloy](../language/basic.md) introduction.
