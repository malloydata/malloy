# The Malloy Language

Malloy is a language designed to provide a concise, powerful, and
readable vocabulary to express the kinds of data transformations
needed to extract useful information from a relational database.
Malloy is essentially a Domain-specific Language (DSL) where the
"domain" is "exploration and transformation of SQL datasets."

This section is designed to be an explorable reference to the underlying language.
