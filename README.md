# Malloy
Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. It is both a semantic modeling language and a querying language that runs queries against a relational database. Malloy currently connects to BigQuery and Postgres, and natively supports DuckDB. We've built a Visual Studio Code extension to facilitate building Malloy data models, querying and transforming data, and creating simple visualizations and dashboards.


## Try Malloy

The easiest way to try the Malloy language is the [Malloy Fiddle](https://malloydata.github.io/malloy/fiddle/index.html?q=12+-+Line+Chart+with+two+dimension%3A+Flights+by+Month+and+Length&m=Flights&t=) site. Here you can toggle between saved queries and edit them or write your own against the provided data and models.

### Install the Visual Studio Code Extension

To write your own Malloy models, use the VS Code Extension, currently available for Mac, Linux, and Windows machines.

1. **Download Visual Studio Code**: Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Add the Malloy (pre-release) extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace**: Open VS Code and click the Extensions button on the far left (it looks like 4 blocks with one flying away). This will open the Extension Marketplace. Search for "Malloy" and, once found, click "Install"

3. **Download and unzip the [Sample Models](https://malloydata.github.io/malloy/aux/generated/samples.zip)** (models + data).

4. **Open the samples folder in VS Code**. In VS Code, go to File > **Open Folder**... select samples/duckdb > Open. DuckDB is built into the extension so you're ready to run these.

5. **Start with `1_airports.malloy` in the FAA dataset**. This is a sub-sample of the NTSB Flights dataset. In the editor pane, above `source: airports`, click the word "Preview" to run a `SELECT *`, and click the word "Run" above any query object to run it (see gif below for example).

To get to know the Malloy language, follow [Malloy by Example](https://malloydata.github.io/malloy/documentation/malloy_by_example.html) and/or continue through the numbered models in the FAA directory.

Note: The Malloy VSCode Extension tracks a small amount of anonymous usage data. You can opt out in the extension settings.

## Syntax Example
Here is a simple example of a Malloy query:

```malloy
query: table('malloy-data.faa.flights') -> {
  where: origin ? 'SFO'
  group_by: carrier
  aggregate:
    flight_count is count()
    average_flight_time is flight_time.avg()
}
```

In SQL this would be expressed:
```sql
SELECT
   carrier,
   COUNT(*) as flight_count,
   AVG(flight_time) as average_flight_time
FROM `malloy-data.faa.flights`
WHERE origin = 'SFO'
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY flight_count desc         -- malloy automatically orders by the first aggregate
```
