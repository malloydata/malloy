# Malloy

Malloy is an experimental language for describing data relationships and transformations. It is both a semantic modeling language and a query language that uses an existing SQL engine to execute queries. Malloy currently can connect to BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Trino, or Presto, and natively supports DuckDB. We've built a Visual Studio Code extension to facilitate building Malloy data models, querying and transforming data, and creating simple visualizations and dashboards.

## Installing Malloy

The easiest way to try Malloy is with our VS Code Extension, which provides a place to create Malloy models, execute queries, get help, and more. VS Code is a text editor and IDE (integrated development environment) that runs on your desktop or in your browser. A few ways to install the extension:

- [I already have VS Code](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/setup/extension.html#using-the-malloy-extension-on-your-desktop)
- [I use BigQuery and Google Cloud](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/setup/extension.html#using-the-malloy-extension-on-google-cloud-shell-editor).
- [I have a Github account and want to try Malloy on a `.csv` or `.parquet` file in a repository](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/setup/extension.html#using-the-malloy-extension-on-github-dev).

To get to know the Malloy language, follow [our Quickstart](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/user_guides/basic.html).

Note: The Malloy VSCode Extension tracks a small amount of anonymous usage data. You can opt out in the extension settings.

## Syntax Example

Here is a simple example of a Malloy query:

```malloy
run: bigquery.table('malloydata-org.faa.flights') -> {
  where: origin = 'SFO'
  group_by: carrier
  aggregate:
    flight_count is count()
    average_flight_time is flight_time.avg()
}
```

In SQL this would be expressed:

```sql
SELECT
   carrier,
   COUNT(*) as flight_count,
   AVG(flight_time) as average_flight_time
FROM `malloy-data.faa.flights`
WHERE origin = 'SFO'
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY flight_count desc         -- malloy automatically orders by the first aggregate
```
